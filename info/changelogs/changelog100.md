# Homeworld: DoK - More Maps v1.0 Changelog
- New "Fathership" and "None" factions
- Added `Gaalsien Base [4]` and `Dune Ocean [6]`, many thanks to FrostyTeeth for these awesome maps!
- Added `Salvage Facility [2]` (testing map), `Kalash Site [6]`, `Tombs of the Ancients [4]`, `Kashar Plateau [6]` and `Prime Anomaly [6]`
  **(Meaning now all maps have a default layout)**
- `Epsilon Base [4]` overhauled into 2v2 map outside the base
- `Cape Wrath [2]` overhauled into a 1v1 map with less tornadoes
- All existing new maps have been improved and polished
- FFA maps can now load layouts
- Layout files can now change map bounds, add new blockers and remove all existing blockers
- Added red sensors mod (off by default on mac - if your sensors turn pink go to `Data/Managed/settings/enemy-sensors.txt` and change the contents to `off`)
- Entire campaign *should* be working now (DM me if you find something that doesn't)
- Skirmish games are read from the map directory whereas multiplayer is hard coded into the DLLs to prevent desyncs from edited layouts
