_Zoom:_
The value in `Data/Managed/settings/zoom.txt` is the amount to increase the max zoom by. 
The default is 0 meaning your zoom is the same as vanilla. For reference, your vanilla max zoom is 1500.

_Enemy Sensors:_
`Data/Managed/settings/enemy-sensors.txt` either turns on or off the red enemy sensors. Must say `on` to turn them on, anything else will turn them off. If you get pink sensors everywhere, change this to `off`.
The default for Mac is `off` since its most common on Mac. `on` is default for PC.
