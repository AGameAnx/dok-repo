# dok-repo: More Maps repository for layouts and patches
Please add a description for your uploads here and sort alphabetically by `Name`.
If you want to upload a temporary testing layout or patch put a dash before its name and don't add it to the list.
Use only dashes as spaces, not underscores, that way people won't have to remember which have dashes and which have underscores.
